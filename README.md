# CompetitveLotkaVolterra

Studying dynamical systems.

Studying the competitve Lotka Volterra model, which is a species dynamics model between two competing species. Initially looking at 2 species just to get the model to work. I aim to generalize it to a larger number of species for some more interesting results. The purpose of this is to eventually simulate a simplified ecosystem. It includes plots of the different population sizes over time as well as a phase plot comparing the two species against each other. It is clear that for the parameters used, the species populations are not periodic.
