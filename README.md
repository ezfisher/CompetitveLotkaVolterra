# CompetitveLotkaVolterra

Studying the competitve Lotka Volterra model, which is a species dynamics model between two competing species. Initially looking at 2 species just to get the model to work. I aim to generalize it to a larger number of species for some more interesting results. The purpose of this is to eventually simulate a simplified ecosystem.
